# Movie Trailer Project Description

This program allows to dynamically create a webpage with the list of movies that were stored beforehand. Each movie is represented by a poster image with its title, its short description and allows the user to watch the trailers of the videos by clicking on film images. 

# Directory Structure

In the GitHub *udacity/movie-trailer/standard* repository you will find the following files:
  1. `media.py` - the file contains all the information related to the `class Movie()`   
  2. `fresh_tomatoes.py` - contains all the HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON code that allows to design, generate and create the .html file
      displayed in the browser.
  3. `entertainment_center.py` - this files contains the list of all the movies displayed on the webpage
  4. `README.md` - contains a short "How To" to run the program.
  
# Requirements

Please make sure that a 2.7 version of Python is installed on your machine (as the code is adapted to this version of Python). 

# Installation

1. Download the files from the GitHub repository. It's important that *all* the files are saved within the same folder on your computer.
2. Open the terminal on your machine (if you use Mac: go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal, on Windows machines it corresponds to Start > Program Files > Accessories > Command Prompt).
3. Navigate in the terminal to the folder that contains the downloaded files.
4. Run the `entertainment_center.py` file. 

# Expected Outcome

On running the `entertainment_center.py` file, a new tab will open in your browser and a webpage with the posters of my favourite movies will be displayed. By clicking on a poster image, you will activate the video trailer which will be displayed in the center of the page. The video will start automatically once you click on the poster and the player window opens. The video will stop automatically and the player will be closed, if you click outside the video window or close the player. On hovering the images, a short movie description will be displayed over the poster. 

# License

The `fresh_tomatoes.py` code was provided by Udacity in its course, the rest of the files were created by the owner of this repository on the basis of the introductory course to Python class given by Udacity. All poster images were taken from Wikipedia, just like the short descriptions of the films.
